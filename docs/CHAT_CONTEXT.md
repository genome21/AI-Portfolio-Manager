# AI Portfolio Manager - Chat Context

This document provides essential context for continuing development of the AI Portfolio Manager project in a new chat thread.

## Project Overview

The AI Portfolio Manager is a financial advisory system built on Google Cloud that uses DialogFlow and Agent Builder for the frontend and Cloud Functions for the backend tools. It helps retail investors with market analysis, portfolio optimization, strategy creation, and investment education.

## Current Status

The project has a complete working structure with all major components implemented using mock data:

1. Created `scheduled_analysis.py` with mock market data to fix the volatility_opportunities endpoint
2. Updated `agent_api.py` to use mock data instead of fetching from Cloud Storage 
3. Successfully implemented all tool endpoints
4. Developed comprehensive examples for tool usage
5. Created documentation (README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Key Files

- `market_scanner.py`: Handles market volatility scanning
- `portfolio_manager.py`: Analyzes and optimizes portfolios
- `strategy_generator.py`: Generates investment strategies
- `trade_executor.py`: Simulates trade execution
- `agent_api.py`: Contains API endpoints and tool integration
- `scheduled_analysis.py`: Provides mock market data
- `main.py`: Routes requests to appropriate handlers

## Tool Endpoints

1. `/volatility_opportunities`: Finds high-volatility trading opportunities
2. `/analyze_symbol`: Analyzes specific stocks
3. `/portfolio_analyzer`: Evaluates investment portfolios
4. `/generate_investment_strategy`: Creates personalized strategies
5. `/educational_content`: Provides investing education
6. `/sector_analysis`: Analyzes market sectors
7. `/execute_portfolio_action`: Simulates trade execution

## Implementation Details

- All endpoints work with mock data
- Fixed bug in volatility_opportunities endpoint by creating scheduled_analysis.py with mock data
- Discussed potential yfinance integration for real-time data
- Created examples for Agent Builder conversation flows
- System is deployed to Google Cloud Functions

## Future Enhancements

1. Potential integration with yfinance for real-time stock data
2. Enhanced portfolio analysis metrics
3. Additional visualization capabilities
4. Portfolio tracking functionality

## Recent Work

Most recent work focused on:
1. Creating test prompts for each tool endpoint
2. Developing examples in consistent format for Agent Builder
3. Creating ARCHITECTURE.md documentation
4. Discussing yfinance integration possibility

## Development Environment

`C:\Users\theca\Downloads\AI Portfolio Manager`

## Deployment

All components are deployed to Google Cloud, with:
- Tools in Cloud Functions
- Frontend using Agent Builder and DialogFlow Conversational Agents
